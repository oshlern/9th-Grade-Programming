  This algorithm is a simple implementation of k-rank approximation using openCV and numpy.
It calculates the singular values of each color separately, replaces a percentage of them with 0's, and reconstructs the image of each color.
Lastly, it puts it back together and displays it, the compressed image.
  All of these images only use the first 10% of their singular values while retaining a relatively accurate approximation.
The file size usually increase after compression, an inflation effect which I believe was covered by others.
However, 2 out of the seven did decrease in size.

  One problem has occurred (which I am working to fix):
There are spots which are mapped to the maximum value for some colors, and they appear is anomalous bright spots in an otherwise possibly dark region.
