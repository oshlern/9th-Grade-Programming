1    In Worcester, Massachusetts,
2    I went with Aunt Consuelo
3    to keep her dentist’s appointment
4    and sat and waited for her
5    in the dentist’s waiting room.
6    It was winter. It got dark
7    early. The waiting room
8    was full of grown-up people,
9    arctics and overcoats,
10    lamps and magazines.
11  My aunt was inside
12  what seemed like a long time
13  and while I waited I read
14  the National Geographic
15  (I could read) and carefully
16  studied the photographs:
17  the inside of a volcano,
18  black, and full of ashes;
19  then it was spilling over
20  in rivulets of fire.
21  Osa and Martin Johnson
22  dressed in riding breeches,
23  laced boots, and pith helmets.
24  A dead man slung on a pole
25  --“Long Pig," the caption said.
26  Babies with pointed heads
27  wound round and round with string;
28  black, naked women with necks
29  wound round and round with wire
30  like the necks of light bulbs.
31  Their breasts were horrifying.
32  I read it right straight through.
33  I was too shy to stop.
34  And then I looked at the cover:
35  the yellow margins, the date.
36  Suddenly, from inside,
37  came an oh! of pain
38  --Aunt Consuelo’s voice--
39  not very loud or long.
40  I wasn’t at all surprised;
41  even then I knew she was
42  a foolish, timid woman.
43  I might have been embarrassed,
44  but wasn’t.  What took me
45  completely by surprise
46  was that it was me:
47  my voice, in my mouth.
48  Without thinking at all
49  I was my foolish aunt,
50  I--we--were falling, falling,
51  our eyes glued to the cover
52  of the National Geographic,
53  February, 1918.
54  
55  I said to myself: three days
56  and you’ll be seven years old.
57  I was saying it to stop
58  the sensation of falling off
59  the round, turning world.
60  into cold, blue-black space.
61  But I felt: you are an I,
62  you are an Elizabeth,
63  you are one of them.
64  Why should you be one, too?
65  I scarcely dared to look
66  to see what it was I was.
67  I gave a sidelong glance
68  --I couldn’t look any higher--
69  at shadowy gray knees,
70  trousers and skirts and boots
71  and different pairs of hands
72  lying under the lamps.
73  I knew that nothing stranger
74  had ever happened, that nothing
75  stranger could ever happen.
76  Why should I be my aunt,
77  or me, or anyone?
78  What similarities--
79  boots, hands, the family voice
80  I felt in my throat, or even
81  the National Geographic
82  and those awful hanging breasts--
83  held us all together
84  or made us all just one?
85  How--I didn’t know any
86  word for it--how “unlikely”. . .
87  How had I come to be here,
88  like them, and overhear
89  a cry of pain that could have
90  got loud and worse but hadn’t?
91  The waiting room was bright
92  and too hot. It was sliding
93  beneath a big black wave,
94  another, and another.
95  Then I was back in it.
96  The War was on. Outside,
97  in Worcester, Massachusetts,
98  were night and slush and cold,
99  and it was still the fifth
100  of February, 1918.
